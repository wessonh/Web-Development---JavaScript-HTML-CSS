Project 1 - Program 1

This program that uses javaScript and HTML to simulate a rock, paper, scissors game. The user will paly against a computer opponent
till they win or loose two out three games. If they draw three times the game will be a tie. The program has a short intro and will ask the user
 to play again after the game is over. WOuld it be better to have a seperate HTML file and Script file or is it okay to combine this one?
